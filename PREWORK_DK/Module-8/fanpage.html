<h2>Argentina + Spain = Great Music</h2>

    <p>Pop/rock band los Rodríguez was formed in Spain by Argentinean singer/keyboardist Andrés Calamaro, ex-los Abuelos de la Nada, who was joined by well-known guitarist Ariel Rot. The band's debut album, called Buena Suerte, was released in 1991, followed by Disco Pirata in 1992. Los Rodríguez's breakthrough came in the mid-'90s when they issued Sin Documentos, with its main title climbing Spanish and Latin charts.</p>

<h2>Genre</h2>

     <p>Their music is a fusion of different styles as flamenco, rumba, bolero, ranchera, milonga, funk, blues.

     Despite their short career, their great success inspired a revolution in the Spanish pop music market, returning attention to groups that sing in Spanish (and bands with Spanish roots).</p>
